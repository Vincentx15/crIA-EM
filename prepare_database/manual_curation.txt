A few obsolete systems are removed 7ny5.
We remove very weird structures (fusion protein or immunoglobulins M)
7khf, 8blq, 7uvl, 8ema, 8ae{0-1-3}, 8ad{x,y}, 7xq8, 7rxd, 7rxc, 7l6m
They were found to cause bugs later on.

We also fix systems where chains are considered separate :
7YVN, chain HI
7YVP, chain IJ
8HHX, chain HI
8HHY, FW-GI
8DXS, FI-GJ
7XOD, RS-UV-XY
7MLV, KF
6XJA (missing chain AB and missing antigen)

Nanobodies were present in the fab files. They were annotated as having just one chain and no antigen partner.
We moved them to the nanobody file :
7zl{g-h-i-j} chain K bound to L
8hi{i-j-k} chain N bound to L
7xw6 chain N bound to AB
7sk7 chain K bound to C
7sk5 chain E bound to C
7zyi chain K bound to L
7xod chain T-W-Z bound to S-V-Y
6ni2 chain A bound to B | V
7wpe chain W-Z bound to V-Y
6ww2 chain K bound to L
7jhh chain N bound to L
7ul3 chain C bound to A
7tuy chain K bound to L

Fabs were present in the nanobody file
7pij chain HL bound to N
7wpd chain XY bound to A
7wpf chain RS, UV, XY
7wpf chain AC-HL bound to E-N
7php chain HL bound to N
7m74 chain HL bound to A

Floating nanobodies (no antigens) were present in the nanobody file
7pij K bound to L
7wpd Z bound to Y
7nkr F bound to A
7wpf T-W-Z bound to S-V-Y
7wpf chain K-F bound to L-C
7php chain K bound to L
7m74 chain N bound to L
7jhg chain N bound to L
7nis-7nk1-7nk2-7nk6-7nkc-7nj4-7nka chain F bound to A/B-A-A/B-A/B-B/C-A-A
